how_it_works:
  - The application fetches the latest cybersecurity news from multiple sources using RSS feeds and the Hacker News API.
  - PHP's `simplexml_load_file()` is used to parse RSS feeds and extract news titles, URLs, and publication dates.
  - The Hacker News API provides top stories, which are filtered to show cybersecurity-related content.
  - The aggregated news is sorted by publication date and displayed in a user-friendly format.
  - The UI is built using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive design.
